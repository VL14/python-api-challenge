Python API Challenge for CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp

WeatherPy:
Python code is written to randomly select 500+ cities around the world using the CityPy API.
The OpenWeatherMap API is used to look up the weather characteristics for each selected city.
Scatter plots are created for all cities in the dataset to compare:

  -Temperature vs Latitude
  
  -Humidity vs Latitude
  
  -Cloudiness vs Latitude
  
  -Wind Speed vs Latitude
  
VacationPy:
The purpose of this Python code is to narrow down the list of world cities from WeatherPy using specific weather
characteristics wanted for a vacation (i.e. temperature, humidity, wind speed).
A heat map is created showing the amount of humidity for all cities selected in WeatherPy.
A final heatmap is shown with the 10 cities selected based on vacation criteria, and these locations are overlayed
on the humidity heatmap.
